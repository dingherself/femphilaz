# 2025 Call for Papers (Draft)

We invite presentations for the 6th Annual Arizona Feminist Philosophy Graduate Conference (FemPhilAZ 2025), to be held on [conference dates], at the University of Arizona with a hybrid in-person/Zoom option for all sessions. Our keynote speakers this year are [keynote speaker 1] and [keynote speaker 2].

The conference is free to register and open to all. The deadline for submission is [submission due date]. Our past programs can be found at <https://femphilaz.com>, with the caveat that we are always in search of approaches, themes, traditions, and voices not well represented in previous iterations of the conference.

**What we are looking for**: We construe feminist philosophy broadly to cover theoretically-oriented interdisciplinary feminist scholarship, history of feminist thought, creative/artistic feminist philosophical work, and contemporary feminist theory and its many intersections—including but not limited to trans/queer feminism, transnational feminism, Indigenous feminism, critical race feminism, ecofeminism, feminist migration/border studies, feminist legal studies, feminist disability studies, feminist science/technology studies, and feminist animal studies.

We encourage interventions that go beyond merely interpreting, explicating, critiquing, applying, or amending existing views, and heavily favor submissions that are not afraid to go out on a limb, grapple with the big normative, analytical, practical, and methodological questions, and provoke new ways of seeing, thinking, and theorizing.

If you would like to attend the conference but do not have work ready to submit at this time, please reach out to us at the email address below and indicate a willingness to be considered as a commentator or chair (please remember to give us a sense of your background and interests!).

**What we are doing to make FemPhilAZ accessible**: As with previous years, FemPhilAZ 2025 will take place with an all hybrid in-person/Zoom format. As a philosophy conference, we have no registration fees.

For accessibility reasons, we ask all in-person attendees to wear N94/N95 or similar masks, which will be available at no cost from the registration table.

Speakers and commentators will be requested to upload, by at least the night before the start of the conference, presentation materials to a confidential shared folder circulated to all conference participants.

The conference venue itself is accessible by wheelchair and is housed in a building with a nursing room (incl. a refrigerator) and a gender-neutral/accessible bathroom. We will make a quiet room available throughout the conference as well.

All food provided will be vegan/vegetarian; we will collect information about additional dietary restrictions prior to the start of the conference.

We expect to be in a position to help offset travel costs for speakers/commentators/chairs with the limited funds we hope to raise, and we are happy to help arrange temporary housing with graduate student hosts (if so desired).

1. An anonymized version of your paper (up to 3,000 words) or creative/artistic work (suitable for a 25-minute presentation), along with an abstract or proposal as appropriate (up to 150 words); and
2. A separate cover letter stating the title of your presentation, your name, email address, and institutional affiliation (if any).

You will receive an email acknowledgement within a couple of days and will be notified of our decision by [due date for decisions]. Every submission will be reviewed anonymously by two of our philosophy graduate students and/or faculty members at the University of Arizona; we are hoping to pass on brief feedback from the reviewers but regrettably cannot guarantee this. If selected, presentations will be accompanied by comments, after which there will be a general Q&A.

Unaffiliated scholars/artists without a terminal degree (e.g., PhD, JD, MFA), as well as undergraduate students, are also welcome to submit. Co-authored submissions are eligible so long as none of the authors has received their terminal degree at the time of submission, except that graduate students pursuing joint degrees (e.g., PhD-JD) are always eligible. With apologies, we will not consider submissions from students currently enrolled in any academic or professional programs at the University of Arizona; we courage you to volunteer as a commentator or chair instead (please see instructions above).
