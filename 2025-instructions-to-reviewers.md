# 2025 Instructions to Reviewers (Draft)

We want to express our thanks again for offering your time to review submissions for the conference. FemPhilAZ 2025 would not be possible without you; we really appreciate your support.

- **[New]** We have faced declining submissions over the past few years. This time, we are encouraging not only submissions from graduate students in analytic philosophy departments but also feminist philosophical work that may be more interdisciplinary, may be more historical, or may be done in a non-traditonal/more creative format. We would also like to encourage more ambitious submissions that provoke new ways of seeing, thinking, and theorizing rather than add epicycles to epicycles, even if this may mean the argument is not as watertight or that the details are not as worked out. We therefore request that reviewers take into account the *potential* of the paper’s contribution, including whether/how much it would benefit from presentation at FemPhilAZ, when this becomes a relevant factor. [For reference, our CFP is here.](https://www.femphilaz.com/2025-call-for-papers/)
- **[New]** We want to experiment with passing on brief reviewer comments to authors, with the hope of pushing other conferences to do the same. Of course, we will *not* share the numerical scores you give, and please feel free to mark anything as “confidential to co-organizers.”
- The authors have a maximum of 3,000 words to work with. Please keep this in mind when reviewing as well. Many of these papers are quite brief, but as best you can, please try to evaluate them given how well they were executed given our admittedly stringent length specifications.
- We tried our best to match papers with reviewers’ interests as much as possible, but we have a limited number of reviewers. Even if you don’t feel you are an expert in the fields a paper engages with, we ask that you give your best shot. But if you feel like you *really* can’t review the paper, please let us know as soon as possible and we will redistribute the paper.
- We will follow past practices of giving reviewers the first bid on being commentators.

Please include the following in your review:

1. **A numerical score** reflecting your judgment of the quality of the paper, using the scale below. Please feel free to use half-points if useful. The numerical scores will never be shared with the authors.
   - **5** for papers that in your judgment should definitely be invited for presentation.
   - **4** for papers that you think should be invited, but about which you have some reservation. Please specify your reservation.
   - **3** for papers that you consider to have important flaws. Please specify the flaws.
   - **2** for papers that you think should not be invited for presentation.
   - **1** for papers that do not meet the minimum standards for this kind of conference.
2. Please provide **a brief comment** on the paper. A few sentences/short paragraph is fine, though we, of course, welcome more detailed feedback. No summary is necessary. *If there is any part of your comment that you do not wish to be passed on to the authors, please distinguish that in some clear way as “confidential to co-organizers.”*
3. Would you want to serve as the **commentator** for this paper if it were accepted?
