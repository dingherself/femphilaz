The University of Arizona occupies the land and territories of the Tohono O’odham and Yaqui Peoples in the heart of the Sonoran Desert.

- The **Tohono O’odham** (lit. “Desert People”) have lived here for at least ten thousand years. Their ancestral land is torn apart by the present-day U.S. and Mexico “border” (which they do not recognize), and U.S. border patrol has frequently arrested and even “deported” them.
- The **Yaqui** community here is a diaspora that fled genocide at the hands of the Mexican government in the late 19th to the early 20th century.

The area is served by:

- The **Tucson International Airport (TUS)** is a 20-minute drive (8.5 miles) to campus. You can use rideshare, and we’d be happy to find local grad students to pick you up as well. (Note that [Southwest](https://www.southwest.com/) flights may not show up on third-party sites like Google Flights, [for interesting reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-m_Jjse-cs).)
- The **Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX)** is a 1.5- to 2-hour drive (115 miles) to campus, contingent on highway traffic. The [Groom shuttle](https://groometransportation.com/tucson/#fares) (around 50 USD each way) stops on campus, but please check with Ding to see if they could pick you up from PHX directly.
- The **Amtrak** [Sunset Limited](https://www.amtrak.com/sunset-limited-train) may be an interesting option if you are coming from/to LA or El Paso.

A free-to-ride **streetcar** [Sun Link](https://www.suntran.com/routes-services/sunlink/) runs between campus and downtown.

*Lodging*:

- **Keynote speakers**: we’ll book the [Marriott](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Cn9yTCY2nhhZSKYR9) for you, which is a 8-minute walk from the department/conference venue.
- **Grad students**: we are happy to arrange homestays with our local grad students so you wouldn’t need to pay for a hotel, but you are of course welcome to find your own lodging option (in addition to the Marriott, try the [Aloft](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/tusal-aloft-tucson-university/overview/), the [Graduate](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/tusgtgu-graduate-tucson/), or somewhere along 4th Ave or Congress St—but stay east of the I-20 so it’s not too far).
