<h1>2025 Conference</h1>

<p>FemPhilAZ 2025 will continue to be offered in an all hybrid in-person/Zoom format. Our in-person venue will be the <strong>Maloney Seminar Room</strong>, Social Sciences Building Room 224 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bwDZWM5WTgu8BWWk7">1145 E South Campus Dr</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>The Social Sciences Building is wheelchair accessible via a side door facing the parking lot, and from there an elevator can take you to the second floor.</li>
    <li>For accessibility reasons, we ask all in-person participants to wear N94/N95 or similar masks, which may be picked up at no cost from the registration table.</li>
    <li>A nursing room (Social Sciences 113) and a quiet room ([quiet room number]) are available for use. Please note that the quiet room is an office that must be locked when there is no one inside, but any Arizona grad student can let you in.</li>
    <li>The University of Arizona supports the option of individuals to use the restroom that meets their individual needs or in which they feel safest; in addition, an all-gender bathroom can be found on the third floor (Social Sciences 309). (If you are feeling adventurous, there is a secret all-gender bathroom inside the auditorium, Social Sciences 100, in the backstage.)</li>
