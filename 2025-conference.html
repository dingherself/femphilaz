<h1>2025 Conference</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: January 20, 2025</em></p>

<p>FemPhilAZ 2025 will continue to be offered in an all hybrid in-person/Zoom format. Our in-person venue will be the Department of Philosophy’s <strong>J. Christopher Maloney Seminar Room</strong>, Social Sciences Building Room 224 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bwDZWM5WTgu8BWWk7" target="_blank">1145 E South Campus Dr</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>The Social Sciences Building is wheelchair accessible via a side door facing the parking lot, and from there an elevator can take you to the second floor.</li>
    <li>For accessibility reasons, we ask all in-person participants to wear N94/N95 or similar masks, which may be picked up at no cost from the registration table.</li>
    <li>A nursing room (Social Sciences 113A) and a quiet room (<a href="https://classrooms.registrar.arizona.edu/27/308" target="_blank">Social Sciences 308</a>, which is a classroom that we have reserved) are available for use.</li>
    <li>The University of Arizona supports the option of individuals to use the restroom that meets their individual needs or in which they feel safest; in addition, an all-gender bathroom can be found on the third floor (Social Sciences 309). (If you are feeling adventurous, there is a secret all-gender bathroom inside the auditorium, Social Sciences 100, in the backstage.)</li>
